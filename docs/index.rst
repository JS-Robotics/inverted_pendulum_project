Inverted Pendulum Documentation
=============================================

Let's try this out

Inline math is used with Since Pythagoras, we know that :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

Math blocks are used with

.. math::

   (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

   (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

New math block test

.. math::

   a = \inf \int^{a}_{b} x dx

.. math::

   \frac{ \sum_{t=0}^{N}f(t,k) }{N}


Now lets try a coding block

   int a = 0;
   int b = 1;
   float c = static_cast<float>(b);


.. toctree::
