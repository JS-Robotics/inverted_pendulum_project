Control
=======
The inverted pendulum on a cart problem is a classic example because it highlights the importance of feedback
control in stabilizing an unstable system. It has been used as a benchmark problem in control theory and robotics,
and it has also been implemented in various control applications, such as self-balancing robots and segways.

This problem is a challenging control problem because the pendulum is an unstable system, meaning that small
disturbances can cause the pendulum to fall over. As a result, various control strategies have been proposed to stabilize
the pendulum, such as proportional-derivative (PD) control, linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) control, and model predictive control (MPC).

The LQR method will be explored and applied in this project to stabilize the inverted pendulum on a cart system.
